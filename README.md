# B2B Monthly Performance Analysis

## Overview
This repository hosts the B2B Monthly Performance Analysis Dashboards, designed to monitor and analyze business-to-business (B2B) operations. The dashboards offer a high-level overview of broad metrics and a detailed breakdown by Line of Business (LOB), focusing on Monthly Recurring Charge (MRC) and gross values to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the B2B segment's performance.

## Goal
